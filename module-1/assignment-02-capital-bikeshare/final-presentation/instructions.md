Finally, the Big day has arrived. You have to prepare yourself to impress our clients with your deep analytics and insights.<br>
<br>
For that, You will create a PowerPoint report that will be presented to the management team of 'Capital bikeshare' which will help them understand their business better and drive decisions about marketing & future plans through analysis and forecasting.<br>
<br>
Richard also has some technical background before, so it would be a good idea if you keep both powerpoint presentations and jupyter notebook ready during your business speech.<br>
<br>
As I have seen, you have plotted so many great graphs for this project. However,  I would request you to choose limited graphs that explain your results best. People get tired of looking at too many numbers while they listen to the speech (Model performance metrics can better be represented visually instead of raw numbers).<br>
<br>
To keep the audience engaged and attentive, you can think of some innovative plans (do not give a shock though) that can even include some examples of other bike sharing companies and how they harnessed the digitalisation to have business growth.<br>
<br>
The presentation is supposed to include but not limited to below guidelines(these are not in order):<br>
<br>
    Visualizations with Analysis. Minimum of 3 interesting insights consisting of Day, Week and a time period of your choice.<br>
<br>
    You are encouraged to use Facebook Prophet for TimeSeries forecasting.<br>
<br>
    Present the attributes which help understand the users behaviour and preferences in context of the business. Here, you can choose to be a bit technical and show which machine learning algorithm(s) explained your analysis the best.<br>
<br>
    Time series visualisations which include decompositions and forecasting. Forecast of business growth is of particular importance for Richard. You can include the latest data from their websites. Also, it would be a common expectation from the management to know how accurate were your forecasts.<br>
<br>
    (Optional) - Supply and Demand analysis (based on bike stations). For example, many bike riders choose to start from 'bike station 1' and there might be less availability of bikes. Similarly, the opposite might happen in other stations.<br>
<br>
    A good analysis on KPIs and how the business can harness the power of analytics to improve on those KPIs.<br>
<br>
    (Optional) - How Microservices are playing a role in transforming businesses. Richard also might be interested to know if they can use anything as such. As you have already built some Flask Apps, these applications can be provided as 'value added services' to them.<br>
<br>
I would recommend if you have built any cool app (cloud deployment even better), please show it to the management.<br>
<br>
    Suggest other types / sources of data you believe might be needed to improve the analysis.<br>
<br>
    Without recommendations, a speech from a Data analyst is incomplete. So, do not forget to include at least 3 of them with proper justifications.<br>
<br>
<br>
This time, you can extend the presentation by 5 more mins and make it of 20 mins.

### goals:

1. Understand business
   1. Higlight business problems
   2. 
2. marketing& plans through analysis and forecasting

### guidelines
1. include notebook
2. rather graphs (especially for metrics) than numbers
3. innovative ideas preferably applied in other companies (and their outcomes)
4. try Facebook Prophet
5. present the attributes which help undertand the users behavior and preferences in context of the business. advised to use an ML algorithm and explain it
6. Time series visualisation whith decomposition and forecasting, super important. include metrics
7. supply and demand analysis (based on bike stations)
8. KPI and how analysis can improve performance in those metrics
9. think about deploying predictions in an app to address a problem
10. suggest types/sources of data needed to improve the analysis
11. 3 justified business recommendations
12. refer to Virginia's wine presentation, consulting firma presentations on designing the presentation.
