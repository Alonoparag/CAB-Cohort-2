    "## Regarding bike availability\n",
    "   * Request from DataOps to track the number of total available bikes\n",
    "   * Allocate a budget to create live tracking of bikes around the city\n",
    "   * Create a bike allocating service to move bikes to demand zones during peak demand:\n",
    "      * Either a service within Capitalbike\n",
    "      * A pay per gig system where users can get paid/receive benefits for moving bikes during peak demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regarding effects of weather on bike use:\n",
    "   * Coordinate special offers/membership sale on the fall months might increase sales since members will use bikes more when weather changes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Regarding effects of pollution on bike use:\n",
    "   * Increasing the amount of time included in a single trip from 30min to 60min during pollution time, both for casual users (single trip) and registered members might increase bike use and decrease pollution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regarding effects of traffic on bike use:\n",
    "   * At the moment there is no available data of traffic to analyse its effects on bike use. I recommend to allocate budget for a project on this matter"
